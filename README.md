## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a basic HTML web application using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline powered by **GitHub Actions**. The goal is to eliminate manual deployment steps by setting up a process that automatically triggers upon changes pushed to the `main` branch, ensuring quick, reliable, and repeatable deployments.

The website consists of three simple pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html`. Once changes are pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions picks up the changes and deploys them to **GitHub Pages** automatically, making the latest version of the website live in just seconds.
